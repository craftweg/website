I'm Pedro Piñera, a software developer from Spain based in Berlin.
I am a Senior Staff Developer at [Shopify](https://shopify.com) in the CLI Foundations team.
We build the [CLI](https://github.com/shopify/cli) that developers use to build on the platform.
I enjoy devising and building tools for developers that are a joy to use,
like [Tuist](https://tuist.io), which I created in 2015, and eventually handed over.
I continuously advocate for more open human software as the foundation for better societies and use some of my spare time to contribute to it. I also like learning new languages and technologies and building with them. Most recently, I’ve been playing with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

When I’m not tinkering with software, I like spending time with family and friends, running, and traveling to new places.

## Values

### Genuineness
We trust things and people when authentic and don’t try to make up a false appearance. We often encounter banal elements on the Internet, and we find it hard to trust them. Since we believe in being authentic, we seek authenticity ourselves. If we feel bad, have flaws, did something wrong, or feel excellent, that’s what we share with others. We don’t expect the same from others, nor we’d push them to do so.

### Openness
We believe in being open and sharing our learnings, mistakes, work, and experiences with others. We learned this value from my experience doing open-source work, which applies to other areas. We are open and direct when talking to people, dumping thoughts on our blog, or discussing GitHub. When openness is reciprocal, it inspires excellent interactions between people.

### Humility
We keep our feet on the floor and don’t forget where we come from. We exercise appreciation, which helps us stay humble and not let our ego devour us. We are not people that want to see ourselves as unique, so when people see us through those lenses, we invite them not to do so by being casual and approachable people.

### Human-first
It's easy to lose our way in technology and forget that technology's ultimate goal is to empower and help people. We are a considerable detractor of companies like Facebook that exploit the vulnerabilities of human beings. When we design and build software, we put people first. Helping them is far more important to us than building a successful product that worsens people's lives.

### Directness

We like communication that is clear and direct. We appreciate this from the German culture, from which we’ve learned a lot. We’ll expect that from interactions with other people, and you should expect the same from us.
