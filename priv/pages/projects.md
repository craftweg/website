We don’t have a strong opinion when it comes to problems to solve and the technologies to solve them. We work on problems that we find exciting to solve and choose technologies that we think are the most suitable to solve the problems, except when we want to play with a particular technology. This page contains projects created by Craftweg, some of which might not be maintained anymore or have been handed over to other maintainers.

## Maintained

### [typed-file-system-path](https://github.com/craftweg/typed-file-system-path)

A tiny NPM package that provides Typescript primitives to model absolute and relative paths and prevent bug-prone implementations and non-idiomatic APIs.

## In progress

### [Gestalt](https://gestaltjs.org)

We are building a batteries-included full-stack Javascript framework. We are going deep into the stack of packages, tools, and APIs to build a well-tested and thought-of foundation to make web apps and sites with Javascript fun, a long-term foundation that organizations can safe and calmly run their projects on.

### [Catalysis](https://twitter.com/catalysisdotdev)

We are building a simple, open-source deployment tool with a strong focus on the developer experience, a tool that’s driven by a community instead of corporations or investors.

## Handed over

### [Tuist](https://tuist.io)

We devised and built a tool to help work with Xcode projects at scale. When we set out to build Tuist, only the large companies could afford to maintain large modular projects and speed up builds through remote cache. We democratized the solution and built a community around the tool.
It becamse the day-to-day tool of companies building iOS apps like [Monday.com](https://monday.com/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/europe), [Houzz](https://www.houzz.com/), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/), [American Express](https://www.americanexpress.com/), [Target](https://www.target.com/), and a bunch of other.

Our distance from the problem space called for a new maintainer that could better lead the project, so that's what we ended up doing.
