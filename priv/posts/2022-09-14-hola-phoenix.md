For the past weeks, I've been [learning](/blog/2022/08/25/on-learning-elixir) [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/), but unlike what happened to me with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), this time, I wanted to use it in an actual project to consolidate the concepts and ideas. Aren't personal websites the best playgrounds? I don't know about yours, but mine is. So I've gone ahead and re-implemented it using Phoenix. It might sound unnecessary over-engineering when I could use a simple static generator and distribute static assets through a CDN network instead of having a long-running server. Yet, it's damn fun to build something from scratch and learn new things along the process. The repository is [open source](https://github.com/craftweg/website) if you want to check the code out. There's nothing special in it, just a standard Phoenix application. I've also got back to using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's easy to integrate into Phoenix, and I don't have to think about how to name classes to use them in CSS selectors. In case you wonder, I haven't taken any template. Styling always intimidated me, but this time I dared to take raw HTML and start applying styles until it looked nice. I'm all ears if you have suggestions for things you'd do differently. I'm trying to exercise the creative side of my brain before it atrophies.

It's been a great experience, and I'm excited to continue building with Elixir. I might put [Gestalt](https://gestaltjs.org) aside and start playing with the idea I've had for quite a while. Building an open-source deployment tool with a great developer experience takes the things I like from platforms like [Fly](https://fly.io), [Netlify](https://netlify.com), and [Heroku](https://heroku.com). I don't know how crazy this is, but I find the challenge of creating something simple and open source and building a community around it very appealing.
