As a business founder, I noticed it’s common to look at a business through the lenses of outcompeting companies in an existing market. Often companies do so through a better value-cost tradeoff. However, I notice that it’s not an approach that aligns with me because it often leads to little innovation and cargo-culting solutions without questioning whether they are still relevant.

I believe this is the common approach to creating businesses when they are backed by investment. Investors need certainty, and there’s nothing like the certainty of knowing a given market and the value in it. The idea of redefining or defining a market sounds risky. But not for us. **We’d like [Tuist](https://tuist.io) to be a blue ocean company.**

For us, growth follows great ideas and a true passion for the craft. When growth is the main goal, you likely find yourself lost shooting at the moon trying to create problems and needs and convincing people that they have them. But **when the focus is on the problem and the craft, a lot of wonderful things happen.** Not only they can unlock new growth opportunities, but they turn you into a company that can sustain better long-term.

I find a lot of joy in experiencing growth following innovative craft.

We are shaping the Tuist environment to be a space for innovation. I spend time looking at what happens in other ecosystems with curiosity, and wondering how those ideas could cross-pollinate into the Apple ecosystem. The connection of ideas also leads to new unique ideas that had never been seen before, and that’s beautiful. I also love challenging solutions that, despite being far from ideal in terms of development, became the norm and no one dares to present an alternative. For example, developers in the Apple ecosystem love writing Swift, *so why are we still writing CI pipelines in YAML or automation in Ruby?* Those are questions that I love to ask myself. And you know what, I'm not afraid to challenge the status quo. Nor do we have a superior entity that we need to justify our decisions. We are free to innovate and create new market opportunities.

Being able to devote my full time to Tuist is one of the best things that has happened to me in the past year,
and I don't regret a single day of it.
