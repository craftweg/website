title: Halting the GestaltJS development

If you have followed my work for a while,
you probably know that I've been working on a full-stack Javascript framework,
[GestaltJS](https://github.com/gestaltjs/gestalt).
I started building it inspired by the developer experience that frameworks like [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) provide.
However,
the more I dove into the Javascript ecosystem,
the less excited I felt about building yet another framework.
Especially after realizing that **I was suffering from the ecosystem fatigue to which I was contributing**.
Therefore I decided to **halt the development of the framework**.

I learned a lot through this exercise that I could apply to my job at Shopify, building their CLI for developers.
However,
I think it's the best long-term idea for my mental health and to have the space to focus on myself and my family.
I might go back to using my free time to craft software in the future,
but it'll most likely not be Javascript-based nor have developers as the target audience.
