title: Becoming problem-oriented
description: Being technology oriented brought me great professional growth. However, I'm starting to feel the appetite for being problem-oriented and build small tech products that become a passive source of income.

I’ve always been inclined towards the technology side since I became a developer. I enjoy learning new programming languages and frameworks and understanding the intricacies of building simple experiences for developers through open source. I still like it, but I’m starting to feel **an appetite for solving problems** with small solutions involving technology that has become a passive source of income. Some people call it indie-making of products. For me, it’s having fun designing and building something useful that people would pay for. I don’t plan to stop being an employee. My current job at Shopify is fulfilling, and I’m growing a lot professionally.

I’m already pondering a few ideas, but before I start working on them, I have to learn to put my technology passion aside and treat technology as an implementation detail. As soon as I start thinking about how to solve a particular problem, my thinking goes straight into fantasizing about technologies, programming languages, and in general, very nitty-gritty implementation details that are not needed to start building something. I need to re-program how my brain works. In fact, Twitter doesn’t help because never-ceasing discussions around the best approach to UI on the web make me wonder about the best tool for what I’m about to build. No Pedro! Pick a tool, learn it well, and you can go long distances with it. Look at [Shopify](https://shopify.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) and how far they’ve gone with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).

So my tool will be [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/). I’ve got familiar with the syntax, and the ecosystem is diverse. It provides [many packages](https://hex.pm/) and tools for most of the needs I might have down the road, and its foundation, [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/), and functional programming will be essential to scale if there’s ever a need for it in any of the tools. [@levelsio](https://twitter.com/levelsio/) and his work will be an essential source of inspiration, and I’ll pause my contributions to the open-source [Gestalt](https://github.com/gestaltjs) project.
