  <p><b>Hola ðŸ‘‹.</b></p>

  <p>
    It's <a href="https://twitter.com/pepicrft" target="_blank">Pedro</a>, a software crafter based in Berlin ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª.
    Elixir, Ruby, and Typescript are my go-to programming languages.

  <p>
    In the past, I worked at <a href="https://8fit.com" target="_blank">8fit</a>,  <a href="https://soundcloud.com" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>, and most recently at <a href="https://shopify.com" target="_blank">Shopify</a> as a Senior Staff Developer. At Shopify I built and maintaned tools, services, and CI/CD for mobile developers (e.g., <a href="https://shopify.engineering/mobile-release-engineering-scale-shipit-mobile" target="_blank">Shipit Mobile</a>), managed, formed, and grew teams, and overhauled the <a href="https://shopify.engineering/overhauling-shopify-cli-for-a-better-developer-experience" target="_blank">organization's CLI</a> to improve the developer experience. In my spare time, I authored <a href="https://tuist.com" target="_blank">Tuist</a>, a tool for Xcode developers to maintain and scale their projects, and that's used by large organizations such as <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bloomberg-business-news-daily/id281941097" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/amex-deutschland/id560172227" target="_blank">American Express</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/asana-work-in-one-place/id489969512" target="_blank">Asana</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adidas/id1266591536" target="_blank">Adidas</a>.
