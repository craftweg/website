Hola ğŸ‘‹,
</p>

<p>
I'm Pedro PiÃ±era, <b>a Berlin-based builder</b>, and this is my personal space on the Internet. You can find <a href={~p"/about"}>more about me</a>, read <a href={~p"/blog"}>my streams of thoughts</a>, or <a href="mailto:hola@pepicrft.me">contact me</a>.
</p>

<p>
I'm currently <b>focused</b> on turning <a href="https://tuist.io" target="_blank">Tuist</a> into a sustainable project, <a href="https://tuist.io/cloud" target="_blank">Tuist Cloud</a>. I have a deep interest in helping teams building apps with Xcode scale up their development.
</p>

<p>
This website is intentionally made <b>simple</b> on the outside and the inside because technology doesn't need to be complex.
