  <p>Hola ðŸ‘‹.</p>

  <p>
    It's <a href="https://twitter.com/pepicrft" target="_blank">Pedro</a>, a software crafter based in Berlin ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, and I'm currently building a hub for social localization, <a href="https://github.com/gesttalt" target="_blank">Gesttalt</a>.
    Elixir, Ruby, and Typescript are my go-to programming languages.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the past, I worked at <a href="https://8fit.com" target="_blank">8fit</a>,  <a href="https://soundcloud.com" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>, and most recently at <a href="https://shopify.com" target="_blank">Shopify</a> as a senior staff developer. In my spare time, I authored Tuist, a tool for Xcode developers to maintain and scale their projects, and that's used by large organizations such as <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bloomberg-business-news-daily/id281941097" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/amex-deutschland/id560172227" target="_blank">American Express</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/asana-work-in-one-place/id489969512" target="_blank">Asana</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adidas/id1266591536" target="_blank">Adidas</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>I'm open to new opportunities as a contractor.</b> I have in-depth experience devising and building developer tooling (e.g., CLIs, CI/CD systems, and productivity-oriented tools). I can quickly adapt to new technologies and programming languages. Email me at <a href="mailto:hola@pepicrft.me">hola@pepicrft.me</a> if you'd like to work with me.
